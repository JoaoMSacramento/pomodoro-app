# Pomodoro Timer App

## Overview
Welcome to the Pomodoro Timer App! This project was developed as part of the JavaScript final project for the Codédex website. The Pomodoro Timer App is a simple and effective time management tool created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


## The Pomodoro Technique
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed in the late 80s by Francesco Cirillo. The theory behind this technique is that taking frequent breaks can help improve mental focus and prevent burnout. It enhances mental agility, boosts motivation, and provides a better sense of accomplishment by breaking tasks into smaller chunks. This technique is particularly popular among programmers for these reasons.


## How It Works
The idea is to break down work into short intervals, usually 25 minutes, with short breaks in between sessions, usually 5 to 10 minutes. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, the Italian word for tomato. The goal is to use each Pomodoro to focus on one specific task, then take a break before starting the next one.


## Main Features
- **Start Timer:** The “Start” button initiates the countdown timer for the session.
- **Pause/Resume Timer:** The “Pause” button stops the timer when pressed and resumes it when pressed again.
- **Reset Timer:** The “Reset” button pauses the timer and resets it to the initial configured time.
- **Sound Notification:** A sound notification is played at the end of each session and break period.


## Extra Features Added
In addition to the basic requirements, the following extra features have been added:

- **Session and Break Configuration:** You can adjust the session and break durations via input fields.
- **Break Timer:** After the completion of a session, the timer automatically starts a countdown for the configured break duration.
- **Circle Animation:** A visual representation of the countdown progress using a circular animation.


## Final Project for Codédex
This project was created as part of the final project requirement for the Codédex website. The requirements were to build a Pomodoro Timer App with functionalities to start, pause, reset the timer, and include sound notifications at the end of each session period. The additional features of session and break configuration, break timer, and circular progress animation were added to enhance the user experience and provide a visual representation of the countdown.

Enjoy using the Pomodoro Timer App to manage your time effectively and boost your productivity!
